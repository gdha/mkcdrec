Some history:
On a regular basis people ask questions concerning burning images to a CD-R(W)
and how to verify if the iso 9660 image was burned correctly.
There exist quiet a lot of documents on above items, e.g. check the following 
document "How to burn an ISO image"  at URL:
http://www.e-smith.org/docs/howto/CD_burning_howto.txt

Other more in-depth documents describe the ISO 9660 layout:
- Writing Bootable CD-ROM: Try This At Home by Rob Starrett
  http://www.cdpage.com/Compact_Disc_Variations/bootablecdarticle.htm
- The ISO 9660 File System by Gratien D'haese
  http://www.it3.be/handouts/ISO9960.html

The purpose (or goal):
Personally I find the md5sum calculation on ISO9660 images very useful, but
I seems to loose them all the time and therefore falling into the trap of
having badly images burned on CD-Rs, e.g. my latest RedHat 7.3 installation
failed because I forgot the check the md5sum on CD2 (very frustrating!).
But, I also noticed that RedHat CDs have a md5sum label burned into the image
itself. You can check all the RedHat CDs by selecting "linux mediacheck" at
the first bootstrap phase. Works like a charm. So, I wondered why don't we
try to do the same on mkCDrec made CDs - must be possible. No need anymore to
write down md5sum (written in the mkcdrec.log) - plain simple: stamp the md5sum
onto the ISO9660 image itself.

The search:
After some time searching on the Net I found the needed sources at RedHat -
anaconda-7.3.tar.bz2
Just took the bare minimum sources to check and implant the md5 onto a given
ISO9660 image. For fun, grabbed also the graphical mediacheck sources.
Give them some little tweaks needed to compile (made a special Makefile for
those sources). The credit goes to RedHat and in particular to
Michael Fulbright (msf@redhat.com) for writing this wonderful piece of
software!

The Primary Volume Descriptor (PVD) on ISO9660 images:
For more information on PVD see above mentioned articles.
To examine an image I found another jewel called hexdump
from http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/ (226 bytes long!)

hexdump on a non-md5 branded CDrec.iso shows:
00008370: F001 0020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020  0x8373 is the beginning of

strings /tmp/Cdrec.iso shows the corresponding text:
ISO MD5SUM = 859edd48ad28ce3bbd4e95ce39d6d405
 THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS RUNNING MD5SUM ON THIS ISO!

The last sentence is VERY important to understand! The software from RedHat
calculates the md5sum of the data area on the ISO9660 image and not over the
complete image, which is not possible as writing the md5 would change the md5
of the image otherwise.

The usage:
# make
will compile 2 executables (checkisomd5 and implantisomd5)
# make mediacheck
will compile a graphical newt based executable "mediacheck" (need libraries
newt and slang). Get the best suited RPMs (or whatever) for your distribution:
  - libnewt0.50-devel-0.50.34-2mdk.i586.rpm
  - slang-devel-1.4.4-4.i386.rpm
# make clean
cleans up all objects and executables.

# make install
will copy checkisomd5 and implantisomd5 to /usr/bin directory
(mediacheck has to be copied by hand if you want to install it).

Checking an unbranded image results into:
$ ./checkisomd5 ~/CDrec.iso

FÓ
No checksum information in iso, check skipped.
$ echo $?
255
==> 255 means not branded with a md5sum

ff94f9565a0e4f11e0de98068cf8aebf
Md5sums match.
$ echo $?
1
==> "1" means md5sums matches and "0" when different.

Let us try to implant a md5sum into a already branded image:
$ ./implantisomd5 ~/valhalla-i386-disc2.iso
Application data has been used - not implanting md5sum!
$ echo $?
1

$ ./implantisomd5 ~/CDrec.iso
Read     0 MB
Inserting md5sum into iso image...
md5 = 859edd48ad28ce3bbd4e95ce39d6d405
Done!
$ echo $?
0

and check it again:
$ ./checkisomd5 ~/CDrec.iso
Read     0 MB
859edd48ad28ce3bbd4e95ce39d6d405
859edd48ad28ce3bbd4e95ce39d6d405
Md5sums match.

./mediacheck  ~/CDrec.iso
presents a nice blue-colored newt based check utility (really great).

The Future:
These tools should made available as a separate rpm to be installed on all
GNU/Linux based systems. I decided to add these tools to mkCDrec distribution
for general consumption. Of course, mkCDrec v0.6.5 will start using them.

I guess if enough people ask it to RedHat they might consider to make it
available as a seperate RPM bundle. If not, and only under pressure,
I could made a rpm release seperate from mkCDrec.

Closing remark:
This was done within a few hours (including thinking, experimenting and fetching
the sources). Imagine a "closed" software world and it would have taken me
weeks to write something similar (and probably not as good!).
Thank you RedHat Inc. for the "openess" of your software and of course in
particular Michael Fulbright (msf@redhat.com).
