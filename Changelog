   "VFS: Cannot open root device "<NULL>" or unknown-block(8,2) Please append

   (gdha, 16/06/200)

   in lilo.conf, grub.conf is no longer searched. (liedekef, 5/5/2002)
 - mkmakeISO9660.sh: changed logic so makeISO9660.in is never changed, even
   when an interrupt occurs. In older versions, when interrupting this, the
   makeISO9660.in would get stuck being updated halfway, resulting in newer
   backups to fail on this script. (liedekef, 5/5/2002)
