This backup solution contains the work of a lot of other people too. See
https://mkcdrec.sourceforge.net/credits.html for some of them.

I've made this mkcdrec utility for my special own purposes. Maybe it's also
useful for you. I don't take any responsibilities for what you are doing with
it, especially I will not be responsibile if you fail to restore a backup, which
you had created with it. At the moment it is still an early beta version, which
is tested but cannot give any guarantees.
NO WARRANTY!

******************************************************************************
Be aware: mkCDrec is not designed to replace backups! I repeat: backup your
system first before playing with mkCDrec. Do not yell at me when you loose 
data due to mkCDrec and you forgot to backup first!
